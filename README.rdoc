== Geek Painter

A very simple DSL to generate a colored shell prompt to use in *nix OS

== Installation
	
	gem install geek_painter
	
== Usage
	
	#put the following lines in a file (ie. geek_painter_client.rb or whatever you want)
	painting = GeekPainter.paint do
	  trace "[".in    :brown
	  trace "\\u".in  :red
	  trace ":".in    :yellow
	  trace "\\h".in  :red
	  trace "] ".in   :magenta
	  trace "\\w ".in :default
	  trace "\$(__git_ps1)".in :yellow
	  trace " $ ".reset
	end
	
	#it shows the actual string ready to be copied and pasted in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile files like this => PS1='the_string'
	# just do: $ruby geek_painter_client.rb
	painting.print_raw
	
	#the GeekPainter#show method is meant to be used when geek painter is used like this:
	#
	#  in ~/.bashrc
	#	    PS1='$(ruby geek_painter_client.rb)'
	painting.show


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
